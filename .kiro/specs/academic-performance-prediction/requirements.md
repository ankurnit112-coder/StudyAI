# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Academic Performance Prediction System is an AI-powered platform designed specifically for CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) students in India. The system leverages machine learning models to predict student performance across different subjects, provide personalized study recommendations, and track academic progress. The platform aims to help students, parents, and educators make data-driven decisions to improve academic outcomes through early intervention and targeted support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Student Profile Management

**User Story:** As a student, I want to create and maintain my academic profile with CBSE-specific information, so that the system can provide personalized predictions and recommendations based on my educational context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student registers THEN the system SHALL capture CBSE board details, current class, school information, and demographic data
2. WHEN a student updates their profile THEN the system SHALL validate CBSE-specific fields and maintain data integrity
3. IF a student belongs to CBSE board THEN the system SHALL support class 9-12 academic structures with appropriate subject combinations
4. WHEN profile data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL prompt for required CBSE-specific information before enabling predictions

### Requirement 2: Academic Records Management

**User Story:** As a student, I want to input my academic performance data from various assessment types, so that the system can analyze my learning patterns and predict future performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student enters exam scores THEN the system SHALL support unit tests, mid-term exams, final exams, and board exam formats
2. WHEN academic data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate score ranges according to CBSE marking schemes (0-100 for most subjects)
3. IF exam data spans multiple academic years THEN the system SHALL maintain chronological academic history
4. WHEN subject-wise scores are entered THEN the system SHALL support all CBSE subjects including core and elective subjects
5. WHEN assessment data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL identify missing data points and request completion

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered Performance Prediction

**User Story:** As a student, I want to receive accurate predictions of my future academic performance in different subjects, so that I can focus my study efforts on areas that need improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sufficient academic data exists THEN the system SHALL generate subject-wise performance predictions using multi-target regression models
2. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores indicating prediction reliability
3. IF academic patterns change significantly THEN the system SHALL update predictions and notify about trend changes
4. WHEN new assessment data is added THEN the system SHALL automatically retrain models and update predictions
5. WHEN predictions are displayed THEN the system SHALL show expected score ranges and probability distributions

### Requirement 4: Personalized Study Recommendations

**User Story:** As a student, I want to receive personalized study recommendations based on my performance patterns and learning habits, so that I can optimize my study strategy for better outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance predictions indicate weak areas THEN the system SHALL generate targeted study recommendations
2. WHEN study habits data is available THEN the system SHALL incorporate learning patterns into recommendation algorithms
3. IF a student consistently underperforms in specific topics THEN the system SHALL recommend focused intervention strategies
4. WHEN recommendations are provided THEN the system SHALL include specific CBSE curriculum topics and suggested study duration
5. WHEN study recommendations are followed THEN the system SHALL track implementation and measure effectiveness

### Requirement 5: Real-time Dashboard and Analytics

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view my academic progress and predictions through an intuitive dashboard, so that I can monitor my performance trends and make informed decisions about my studies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current performance metrics, predictions, and trend analysis
2. WHEN dashboard data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates reflecting latest academic inputs
3. IF performance trends show concerning patterns THEN the system SHALL highlight areas requiring immediate attention
4. WHEN analytics are displayed THEN the system SHALL show subject-wise comparisons, historical trends, and peer benchmarking
5. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL complete rendering within 3 seconds for optimal user experience

### Requirement 6: Study Habits Tracking and Analysis

**User Story:** As a student, I want to track my study habits and learning patterns, so that the system can provide insights into how my study behavior affects my academic performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student logs study sessions THEN the system SHALL capture subject, duration, study method, and effectiveness ratings
2. WHEN study patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify correlations between study habits and academic performance
3. IF study habits data shows ineffective patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative study strategies
4. WHEN study analytics are generated THEN the system SHALL provide insights on optimal study times, duration, and methods
5. WHEN study recommendations are implemented THEN the system SHALL track behavioral changes and performance impact

### Requirement 7: Feedback Loop and Model Improvement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI models to continuously improve through feedback mechanisms, so that prediction accuracy increases over time and adapts to changing academic patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN actual exam results are available THEN the system SHALL compare with predictions and calculate accuracy metrics
2. WHEN prediction accuracy falls below threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger automated model retraining
3. IF new academic data patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL adapt feature engineering and model parameters
4. WHEN model performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL maintain accuracy logs and performance benchmarks
5. WHEN feedback is collected THEN the system SHALL incorporate user satisfaction data into model optimization processes

### Requirement 8: Data Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a student, I want my academic and personal data to be securely stored and processed, so that my privacy is protected while using the prediction system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN student data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information using industry-standard encryption
2. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL implement role-based access controls and audit logging
3. IF data breach attempts occur THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent unauthorized access with immediate alerts
4. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL comply with applicable data protection regulations
5. WHEN students request data deletion THEN the system SHALL provide complete data removal capabilities
