# Requirements Document - Logical and Mathematical Error Fixes

## Introduction

This specification addresses the identification and correction of logical and mathematical errors throughout the StudyAI CBSE Board Exam Prediction Platform. The goal is to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability in all calculations, data processing, and logical operations across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mathematical Accuracy in Predictions

**User Story:** As a student using StudyAI, I want all mathematical calculations to be accurate so that my board exam predictions are reliable and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating percentage scores THEN the system SHALL use correct mathematical formulas (obtained_marks / max_marks * 100)
2. WHEN generating grade classifications THEN the system SHALL use consistent and accurate grade boundaries
3. WHEN computing confidence scores THEN the system SHALL ensure values are within valid ranges (0-1 or 0-100%)
4. WHEN calculating improvement predictions THEN the system SHALL use statistically sound mathematical models
5. WHEN displaying decimal values THEN the system SHALL round appropriately and consistently

### Requirement 2: Data Validation and Range Checking

**User Story:** As a student entering exam data, I want the system to validate my inputs so that impossible or invalid data doesn't corrupt my predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters exam marks THEN the system SHALL validate that obtained marks ≤ maximum marks
2. WHEN calculating percentages THEN the system SHALL handle division by zero scenarios gracefully
3. WHEN processing date inputs THEN the system SHALL validate date ranges and formats
4. WHEN accepting score inputs THEN the system SHALL enforce valid ranges (0-100 for percentages)
5. WHEN computing averages THEN the system SHALL handle empty datasets appropriately

### Requirement 3: Logical Consistency in UI Components

**User Story:** As a user navigating the application, I want all interface elements to behave logically and consistently so that the user experience is intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying progress bars THEN the system SHALL ensure progress values match actual completion percentages
2. WHEN showing conditional content THEN the system SHALL use correct boolean logic
3. WHEN filtering data THEN the system SHALL apply filters consistently across all views
4. WHEN sorting lists THEN the system SHALL maintain logical sort order
5. WHEN displaying empty states THEN the system SHALL show appropriate content based on actual data state

### Requirement 4: Statistical and ML Model Accuracy

**User Story:** As a student relying on AI predictions, I want the underlying statistical models to be mathematically sound so that predictions are as accurate as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training ML models THEN the system SHALL use appropriate statistical measures and validation techniques
2. WHEN calculating confidence intervals THEN the system SHALL use correct statistical formulas
3. WHEN computing correlations THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases (perfect correlation, no correlation)
4. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL ensure output ranges are realistic and bounded
5. WHEN evaluating model performance THEN the system SHALL use standard metrics (R², MAE, RMSE) correctly

### Requirement 5: Form Validation Logic

**User Story:** As a user filling out forms, I want validation logic to be accurate and helpful so that I can successfully submit valid data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating email formats THEN the system SHALL use correct regex patterns
2. WHEN checking required fields THEN the system SHALL accurately identify missing data
3. WHEN validating phone numbers THEN the system SHALL accept valid international formats
4. WHEN checking file uploads THEN the system SHALL correctly validate file sizes and types
5. WHEN processing form submissions THEN the system SHALL handle all edge cases gracefully

### Requirement 6: Time and Date Logic

**User Story:** As a user scheduling study sessions and tracking progress, I want all time-related calculations to be accurate so that my planning is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating study durations THEN the system SHALL handle time zone differences correctly
2. WHEN computing time intervals THEN the system SHALL account for daylight saving time changes
3. WHEN displaying relative times THEN the system SHALL show accurate "time ago" calculations
4. WHEN scheduling events THEN the system SHALL prevent logical impossibilities (end before start)
5. WHEN calculating streaks THEN the system SHALL use consistent date comparison logic

### Requirement 7: Performance Analytics Accuracy

**User Story:** As a student tracking my performance, I want all analytics calculations to be mathematically correct so that I can make informed study decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating trend lines THEN the system SHALL use appropriate regression analysis
2. WHEN computing improvement rates THEN the system SHALL handle negative changes correctly
3. WHEN showing comparative statistics THEN the system SHALL use consistent baseline calculations
4. WHEN displaying percentile rankings THEN the system SHALL use correct statistical ranking methods
5. WHEN aggregating scores THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate weighting and averaging

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want the application to handle unexpected situations gracefully so that I don't encounter crashes or incorrect results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering division by zero THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing
2. WHEN processing empty datasets THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messages
3. WHEN handling null or undefined values THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults
4. WHEN encountering network errors THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN processing malformed data THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate inputs

### Requirement 9: Currency and Numerical Display

**User Story:** As a user viewing numerical data, I want all numbers to be formatted consistently and correctly so that information is clear and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying percentages THEN the system SHALL use consistent decimal places
2. WHEN showing large numbers THEN the system SHALL use appropriate thousand separators
3. WHEN displaying currency THEN the system SHALL use correct regional formatting
4. WHEN rounding numbers THEN the system SHALL use consistent rounding rules
5. WHEN showing scientific notation THEN the system SHALL format appropriately for the context

### Requirement 10: Accessibility and Logical Navigation

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the application logic to support assistive technologies so that I can use the platform effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
