## What This Creates
The migration creates these essential tables:
- `users` - User accounts and profiles
- `user_sessions` - Login sessions and tokens
- `academic_records` - Student grades and scores
- `study_sessions` - Study time tracking
- `predictions` - AI predictions for exam scores
- `study_recommendations` - Personalized study suggestions

## Alternative: Use Supabase CLI (Advanced)
If you have Supabase CLI installed:
```bash
supabase db reset
```

## Verification
After running the migration, you can verify it worked by:
1. Visiting: https://studyai-9bvgwfgrn-ankurnit112-5736s-projects.vercel.app/api/setup-db
2. You should see all tables with status "exists"
